The COVID-19 pandemic creates urgent demand for specialized technologies in airports, quarantine zones,
hospitals, logistics infrastructure, and prisons. Companies have devised solutions which can be
replicated in other countries, granted that they can match and talk to the buyers directly.

We want to facilitate the exchange of technology by opening up an open, public database of COVID-19
innovations. Suppliers of tech solutions can directly post their details online, and be openly
searched and browsed by anyone who has a demand, in a peer-to-peer fashion.
