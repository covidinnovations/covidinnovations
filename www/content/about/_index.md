Covid Tenders is a non-profit initiative launched by a group of volunteers. It was started by [Basile
Verhulst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/basile-verhulst-a258a46b/) [(contact)](mailto:basile@blockdynamics.io) who has founded several high-tech
startups in Asia and Paris in the past.

It is an initiative launched and supported by the [French Tech Community in Asia](https://hk.lafrenchtech.com/). La French Tech is a unique movement bringing together startups,
investors, policymakers and community builders to foster the growth of the startup ecosystem in
France and across the world.

We are committed to slow down the spread of the virus and save lives by accelerating the
technological innovation for our healthcare system.

## FAQ

**Q: Has the data on your website been reviewed ? How do I know it is truthful?**

A: [The tenders are being reviewed](/tenders) by covidtenders.org before being listed on the database. However,
the [solution database](/solutions/browse) is entirely crowd-sourced. We will monitor the quality of the data [submitted

or La French Tech does not take any responsibility and does not endorse any solution submitted

through our exchange.
