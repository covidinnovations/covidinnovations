      <description>Covidtenders.org is hiring a Community Manager Dear all,
Thanks to the generous support from a donor, we have received a small amount of funding for our non-profit website. We are thus looking for an experienced community manager and fundraiser that can help us rapidly fund-raise further while coordinating the outreach for our platform. We can compensate you for your time with around $1.5k USD per month. We are looking for someone as close to full-time as possible.</description>
