# Covid Innovations

Thank you for joining our COVID Open Innovation Database. We want to facilitate the exchange of technology to fight COVID by opening up an open, public database of Tenders and Innovations. Suppliers of tech solutions can directly post the detail of their solution online, and be openly searched and browsed by anyone who has a demand, in a peer-to-peer fashion. The goal is to increase the speed of the fight against this virus on global scale !
